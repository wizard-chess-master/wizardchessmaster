## Recent Changes (August 2025)
- **Castling Fix Complete (Aug 14 2025)**: Fixed kingside castling - king now correctly moves to column 7 (h1/h10) instead of column 6, rook moves to column 6. Path validation properly checks columns 6-8 for kingside and columns 1-4 for queenside. System correctly blocks castling when pieces are in the way
- **Campaign Level Requirements Update (Aug 13 2025)**: Progressive campaign challenges - Level 1: 1 win, Level 2: 2 wins + 1 wizard capture, continuing progressively through all 12 levels with increasing win and wizard capture requirements, completion now based on meeting specific goals rather than win rate
