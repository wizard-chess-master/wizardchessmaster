Objective
Enhance Wizard Chess Master AI to be more challenging by training against human players, building on prior 50,000 AI-vs-AI games. Use React/TypeScript/Vite/Express/Socket.IO/PostgreSQL stack on Replit. Focus on data collection, neural net refinement, reinforcement learning, and adaptive strategies for 10x10 board with wizard pieces.
Tasks
1. Data Collection
* Goal: Log human-AI game data (moves, outcomes) in PostgreSQL.
* Steps:
    * Create table for game logs (player ID, moves, result, timestamp).
    * Ensure GDPR-compliant anonymization.
    * Integrate with Express/Socket.IO for real-time logging.
* Sample Code: // schema.sql
* CREATE TABLE human_games (
*   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
*   player_id UUID,
*   moves JSONB,
*   outcome VARCHAR(20),
*   timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
* );
* 
* // server.ts
* import { Socket } from 'socket.io';
* socket.on('gameEnd', async (data: { playerId: string, moves: string[], outcome: string }) => {
*   await db.query('INSERT INTO human_games (player_id, moves, outcome) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)', [
*     data.playerId, JSON.stringify(data.moves), data.outcome
*   ]);
* });
2. Neural Net Enhancement
* Goal: Refine neural net for human-like strategies, emphasizing wizard abilities.
* Steps:
    * Use TensorFlow.js; add layers for teleportation/magical attack patterns.
    * Train on human move patterns from logs.
* Sample Code: import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';
* 
* const model = tf.sequential();
* model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 128, activation: 'relu', inputShape: [100] })); // 10x10 board
* model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 64, activation: 'relu' }));
* model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 32, activation: 'softmax' })); // Move probabilities
* model.compile({ optimizer: 'adam', loss: 'categoricalCrossentropy' });
3. Reinforcement Learning
* Goal: Train AI with human game rewards.
* Steps:
    * Implement Q-learning with rewards: +1 win, -1 loss, 0 draw.
    * Add exploration (epsilon-greedy, 10% random moves).
* Sample Code: const reward = (outcome: string) => outcome === 'win' ? 1 : outcome === 'loss' ? -1 : 0;
* 
* async function trainStep(gameData: { moves: string[], outcome: string }) {
*   const state = encodeBoard(gameData.moves);
*   const action = model.predict(state);
*   const r = reward(gameData.outcome);
*   // Update model with reward
*   await model.fit(state, action, { epochs: 1, sampleWeight: r });
* }
4. Curriculum Training
* Goal: Train progressively on human skill levels.
* Steps:
    * Segment logs by player win rates (amateur, intermediate, expert).
    * Start with amateur moves; transfer to expert.
* Sample Code: const segmentPlayers = async () => {
*   const amateurs = await db.query('SELECT * FROM human_games WHERE win_rate < 0.4');
*   const experts = await db.query('SELECT * FROM human_games WHERE win_rate > 0.7');
*   // Train sequentially
*   for (const game of amateurs) await trainStep(game);
*   for (const game of experts) await trainStep(game);
* };
5. Training Scale
* Goal: Train on 10,000+ human games.
* Steps:
    * Batch process games in Replit; save models to PostgreSQL or localStorage.
    * Optimize memory with async processing.
* Sample Code: async function batchTrain(games: any[], batchSize: number = 100) {
*   for (let i = 0; i < games.length; i += batchSize) {
*     const batch = games.slice(i, i + batchSize);
*     await Promise.all(batch.map(trainStep));
*     await model.save('localstorage://ai-model');
*   }
* }
6. Evaluation
* Goal: Ensure AI is fun/challenging.
* Steps:
    * Simulate vs human-like moves; compute ELO-like rating.
    * Adjust difficulty if too hard/easy.
* Sample Code: async function evaluateAI() {
*   let elo = 1500;
*   const testGames = await db.query('SELECT * FROM human_games LIMIT 100');
*   for (const game of testGames) {
*     const result = simulateGame(model, game.moves);
*     elo += result === 'win' ? 20 : result === 'loss' ? -20 : 0;
*   }
*   console.log(`AI ELO: ${elo}`);
* }
