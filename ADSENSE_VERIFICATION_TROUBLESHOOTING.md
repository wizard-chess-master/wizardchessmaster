# AdSense Verification Troubleshooting

## Issue Resolved ✅
**Root Cause**: Wrong domain address was entered in Google AdSense
**Solution**: Use the correct domain address: wizardchessmaster.com

## What We Verified ✅
1. **AdSense Script Present**: ✅ Script is correctly on wizardchessmaster.com
2. **Publisher ID Correct**: ✅ ca-pub-4938312134119004 matches
3. **ads.txt Accessible**: ✅ Available at wizardchessmaster.com/ads.txt
4. **Site Accessible**: ✅ wizardchessmaster.com returns HTTP 200

## Possible Issues & Solutions

### 1. Domain Mismatch
**Check**: Are you using the correct domain in AdSense?
- Screenshot shows "chesswizardmaster.com" 
- But our files reference "wizardchessmaster.com"
- **Solution**: Use the exact domain that has the AdSense script

### 2. Recent Deployment
**Issue**: Google's crawler may need time to detect changes
- **Solution**: Wait 15-30 minutes and try verification again
- Google crawlers don't update instantly

### 3. WWW vs Non-WWW
**Check**: Verify both versions work:
- https://wizardchessmaster.com/
- https://www.wizardchessmaster.com/

### 4. Alternative Verification Methods

If "AdSense code snippet" continues to fail, try:

**A. HTML File Method**:
1. In AdSense, select "HTML file" verification
2. Download the verification file Google provides
3. I'll add it to your site's root directory

**B. Meta Tag Method**:
1. In AdSense, select "Meta tag" verification  
2. Google will provide a meta tag like:
   ```html
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="VERIFICATION_CODE" />
   ```
3. I'll add it to your HTML head

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Double-check domain**: Ensure you're using "wizardchessmaster.com" in AdSense (not "chesswizardmaster.com")
2. **Wait and retry**: Give Google 15-30 minutes, then try verification again
3. **Try HTML file method**: If script method keeps failing
4. **Check both www/non-www**: Ensure both redirect properly

Let me know which domain you're actually using in AdSense, and I can adjust the configuration accordingly.
