# Performance Optimization Test Guide

## Quick Test Instructions

### 1. View Performance Overlay
**Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`** (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to toggle the performance overlay.

You should see real-time metrics in the bottom-right corner:
- FPS (Frames Per Second) - Green if >50, Yellow if >30, Red if <30
- Memory usage with percentage
- Render time in milliseconds
- Network latency
- Cache hit rate percentage

### 2. Test Automatic Performance Adjustments
The system automatically adjusts when:
- FPS drops below 30 - Reduces visual quality
- Memory usage exceeds 80% - Triggers cleanup
- Network latency is high - Optimizes requests

### 3. Check Console for Performance Logs
Open browser DevTools (F12) and look for:
- ⚡ Performance Optimizer initialized
- ⚡ Performance optimizations initialized
- 👁️ Observing images for lazy loading
- ⚠️ Low FPS detected warnings (when FPS drops)
- 🧹 Performing memory cleanup (when memory is high)

### 4. Features Working Behind the Scenes
- **Lazy Loading**: Images and components load only when visible
- **Passive Event Listeners**: Better scroll performance
- **Debounced/Throttled Operations**: Optimized event handling
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup when usage is high
- **Adaptive Quality**: Visual quality adjusts based on device performance

## Performance Improvements Summary
- **Before**: FPS issues (15-30), slow resource loading (1125-1587ms)
- **After**: Target 60 FPS with automatic adjustments, lazy loading active, monitored memory

## Test Successful If:
✅ Performance overlay appears when pressing Ctrl+Shift+P
✅ FPS shows around 60 (may vary based on device)
✅ Memory percentage is displayed
✅ No console errors related to performance modules
✅ Page feels more responsive

## Current Status
The performance optimization system is fully integrated and running. The overlay will help you monitor real-time performance metrics.
